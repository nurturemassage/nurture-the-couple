## Angela Judy, Owner, Massage Therapist Lic. 6304, Reiki I

Angela Judy received her certificate for massage at Trident Technical College in 2004. She is trained in Swedish, deep tissue, sports, prenatal massage, and triggerpoint therapy. She also uses Active Isolated Stretching to relieve tension in tight muscles. In addition to her massage training, she has been an athletic performing artist (cheerleading, acrobatics, and several forms of dance) since she was 12 years old. She knows how it feels to have pain from overused or torn muscles, dislocated joints, or taking a fall. Angela works well with clients who suffer from headaches, neck pain, and low back/hip pain. With a kind and nurturing personality, she loves to help and care for people and it is this passion that inspired her to open Nurture Massage Therapeutic Spa.
